# Zoom-Class-Logger

Hello Everyone,
Thank you for showing interest in my project which is a simple meeting entry semi-automation using python.

There are a few steps which you would want to keep in mind while working with this porject.

  1. Please give execution writes to your login.sh by writing the command
       chmod +x login.sh in your git bash terminal
  2. Please change the absolute address of the file in zoom_login_class.py 
     to the location where the file already exists in your device.
  
  3. The last point is to modify the Timetable.xlsx according to your classes' link 
     keeping the first class on top and the last class on the bottom of the column entry.
     Make sure not to erase the first row of the excel sheet as the program would fail to execute in that condition.

Keep in mind to change the extension of excel file to .xls if you are using the lastest version of xlrd...
